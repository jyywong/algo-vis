# Algorithm Visualizer

## What is this?
This is a webapp where users can visualize both pathfinding and sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Pathfinding algorithms include Djikstra's Algorithm, A*, and Greedy Best First Search.

## What did I learn?
With this project I delved into D3.js and learned the data binding model of D3.
I learned the basics of how to enter data into D3 objects and how to animate
using transition in D3. Additionally, figuring out how to animate these
algorithms helped me to understand these algorithms on a deeper level.

## What technologies were used in the this project?
- React
- D3.js
- Framer Motion
